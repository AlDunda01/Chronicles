      <li><b><u>Kentaro Miura</u></b>: A Japanese Manga(Graphic Novel) Artist, Kentaro Miura took inspiration from both Western and Eastern sources.

      <li><b><u>Hidetaka Miyazaki</u></b>: Another Fantasy lover hailing from Japan, Miyazaki grew up and admired Miura's Berserk. But rather then heading down the literature path, Miyazaki took his genius to the Video Game department. He joined up with Japanese video game company Fromsoftware to create a series of RPG games that broke the gaming industry. Miyazaki's Soulsborne genre became very acclaimed for its challenging mechanics and overdose of fantasy setting.</li>
